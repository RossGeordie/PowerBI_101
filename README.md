Section 1 - Week 1 - 4

Introduction to Power BI, modelling and DAX, these four weeks will give you an overview of how Power BI is used,
how to get started and how to deliver your first insights to a company. We use two data sets for this, a synthetic
one (Sample-Superstore.csv) and the real-world data from the New York Rooftop Water Tower Inspections (Wk4).
